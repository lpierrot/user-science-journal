                    <h2 class="section-heading">Purpose and Scope</h2>

                    <p>For this week's analysis, I conducted a usability test for
                        <a href="https://swahilivillages.com/" target="_blank">Swahili Village</a> website.
                        A few years ago when I was visiting a couple of friends in Maryland, they recommended we go to
                        eat at this restaurant but since it was a large group of us, we decided on making an online
                        reservation, but the website left us a little puzzled, so we decided to call them. We all
                        thought that having a working reservation page could have made our experience more enjoyable and
                        less time-consuming.</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/swahili-vil-hp.png" alt="Swahili Village">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted"> Swahili Village Homepage</span>
                    <p>After reading Steve Krug's book on usability, I immediately thought of this website and changes
                        that can be made to make it useful. To put the website to the test, I recruited three
                        participants and gave them specific tasks to complete with a few follow up questions and
                        documented the results. The test mainly focused on user-experience navigating the website to
                        complete a specific task, functionalities (links, buttons, drop-down menu), website content, and
                        design flows.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Participants</h2>

                    <p>I recruited three participants; age range was from 20 years to 35 years.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tester 1: Male Software Engineer with bachelor’s degree.</li>
                            <li>Tester 2: Male Customer Service Agent with an AA degree.</li>
                            <li>Tester 3: Female Program Manager with a bachelor’s degree. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Schedule & Location</h2>

                    <p>I contacted three participants via text message for a one on one meeting at <a
                            href="https://www.seattleu.edu/library/" target="_blank">LLMLC </a>, between 9AM
                        and 12PM. The first participant started schedule at 9AM, second participant 10AM and the last
                        participant at 12PM. Each test lasted about 30 minutes, with 15 minutes explaining them what the
                        test is going to cover and the other 15 minutes were allocated to the test. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Equipment</h2>

                    <p>Equipment used wer a MacBook Pro 13 in, windows desktop and iPhone 8 Plus to record and collect
                        data. Three different browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari) were also used thoughtout this
                        test.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Scenarios</h2>

                    <p>I asked the participants to complete four tasks and a few probing questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make an online reservation</li>
                        <li>Cuisine influence or background</li>
                        <li>Find the food menu and happy hour specials</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These scenarios were straight forward, but as we will see in the test results, not all tasks were
                        completed. In fact, some testers reported being confused by some of the features and content on
                        the
                        website.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Summary Test Results</h2>

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/tester1.png" alt="Test one Summary">

                    <p> After the all three participants completed their test, I asked them to rate their top three
                        usability problems:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confusing reservation page</li>
                        <li>Confusing drop-down menu functionality</li>
                        <li>Make the happy hour info clear preferably on the menu page</li>
                        <li>Doesn’t understand the about page</li>
                        <li>Did not like the video on the homepage, they thought it was loud with no option to mute it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Findings and Recommendantions</h2>
                    <p>Based on the usability test results, all three participants spent a significant amount of time
                        trying to figure out how to make an online reservation. Testers one and two left the reservation
                        page and went straight to the contact form to find a phone number.</p>
                    <p>Tester one and two also failed to find happy hour information. Tester one did eventually go back
                        to the homepage and was able to locate the happy hour card. Tester three remembered seeing that
                        information on the homepage, and he also found the video on the homepage annoying. All three participants 
                        located the food menu and the cuisine background right away. They reported seeing this information 
                        in the navbar section.</p>
                    <p>As for recommendations, participants agreed on adding the happy hour information to the food menu
                        and removing the drop-down feature since it had no actual functionality. They also recommended
                        removing the reservation page and adding it to the contact form.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>After analyzing these testers results and performance, it is clear that some pages on the site
                        are confusing. I think changing the template that was used to create the website looks nice, but
                        some pages should be removed, and making the content clear would be helpful to all users.</p>
